[√] Use onLayout to calculate the left of the button pressed in the main navbar, so it's possible to position the submenu based on the left value (maybe centered, or if it's an end component then it goes to the left/right)
[√] Re-do tool navbar with separate components for button with submenu and submenu button
[√] Auto join for line tool end point
[√] Fix misaligned submenu on first press (handle in useNavMenu)
[√] Caret at the bottom of the submenu
[√] Make submenu dynamic (changes children based on the button pressed)
[√] Make icon prop in ToolButton not accept an entire component, just the name
[√] Click on navbar in white space should hide the open submenu
[√] Auto join for brush tool end point
[√] brush-utils and line-utils should be hooks so they can use context
[√] Give UUIDs to paths
[√] Options for auto join distance and to disable it
[√] Use Polyline instead of Path
[√] When creating a new path, get the rectangle boundary of the path 
[√] Get updated top/left/bottom/right points after moving a path
[√] Path jumps around when you try to move it
[√] Can't select line paths
[√] After rotating (via transform), actually move the points of the selectedPath to the new location they should be (via the getTranslatedPoints function)
[√] Get new right and bottom values on rotation (to properly set width and height for rotation box)
[√] Circular rotation (instead of just based on y change)
[√] Rotate selection
[√] Enable de-selecting of selection
[√] Eraser mode (find shapes where x,y is inside the bounding box, then filter the coords based on if the x,y coords are close to them (close = delete the points in the shape))
    [√] Eraser for lines
    [√] Get point group outside box points (a rotated bounding box from each two points in a line), then check if the mouse is inside of those points
    [√] Eraser needs to actually delete the points when erasing (instead it adds points)
[√] Select and delete path
[√] Undo tool
    [√] Create function to find the difference between the paths and find what changed at what path
    [√] Add functions to useHistoryChange and clean up redundant code from toolNavbar, move code from toolNavbar and drawingCanvas into useHistoryChange
    [√] When using the eraser tool, then undoing multiple times, the undo tool does not work after the first undo
    [√] When erasing and splitting up paths, keep one of the paths as the original ID so the number of added paths is 1, removed is 0, and altered is 1
        instead of 2 added and 1 removed
    [√] Need to be able to handle multiple history changes at the same time (e.g. adding a path and altering a different one)
    [√] Redo tool sometimes does not work all the way (e.g. make a square, undo all sides, then redo back to square does not work)
